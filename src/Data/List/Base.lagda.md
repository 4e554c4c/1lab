# The type of lists {defines=list}

This module contains the definition of the type of lists, and some basic
operations on lists. Properties of these operations are in the module
[`Data.List`], not here.

[`Data.List`]: Data.List.html

```agda
private variable
  ℓ : Level
  A B : Type ℓ

infixr 20 _∷_
```
-->

```agda
data List {ℓ} (A : Type ℓ) : Type ℓ where
  [] : List A
  _∷_ : A → List A → List A

{-# BUILTIN LIST List #-}
```

One of the first things we set up is list literal syntax (the
`From-product`{.Agda} class) for lists. The list corresponding to an
n-ary product is the list of its elements.

```agda
instance
  From-prod-List : From-product A (λ _ → List A)
  From-prod-List .From-product.from-prod = go where
    go : ∀ n → Vecₓ A n → List A
    go zero xs                = []
    go (suc zero) xs          = xs ∷ []
    go (suc (suc n)) (x , xs) = x ∷ go (suc n) xs

[_]L : ∀ {ℓ} {A : Type ℓ} {n} → Vecₓ A n → List A
[ p ]L = [ p ]

-- Test:
_ : Path (List Nat) [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] (1 ∷ 2 ∷ 3 ∷ [])
_ = refl
```

## “Fields”

```agda
head : A → List A → A
head def []     = def
head _   (x ∷ _) = x

tail : List A → List A
tail []       = []
tail (_ ∷ xs) = xs
```

## Elimination

As with any inductive type, the type of lists-of-As has a
canonically-defined eliminator, but it also has some fairly popular
_recursors_, called "folds":

```agda
List-elim
  : ∀ {ℓ ℓ'} {A : Type ℓ} (P : List A → Type ℓ')
  → P []
  → (∀ x xs → P xs → P (x ∷ xs))
  → ∀ x → P x
List-elim P p[] p∷ []       = p[]
List-elim P p[] p∷ (x ∷ xs) = p∷ x xs (List-elim P p[] p∷ xs)
```

<!--
```agda
instance
  Foldable-List : Foldable (eff List)
  Foldable-List .foldr {a = A} {b = B} f b = go module foldr where
    go : List A → B
    go [] = b
    go (x ∷ xs) = f x (go xs)


  Traversable-List : Traversable (eff List)
  Traversable-List = record { traverse = go } where
    go
      : ∀ {M : Effect} ⦃ _ : Idiom M ⦄ (let module M = Effect M) {ℓ ℓ'}
          {a : Type ℓ} {b : Type ℓ'}
      → (a → M.₀ b) → List a → M.₀ (List b)
    go f []       = pure []
    go f (x ∷ xs) = ⦇ f x ∷ go f xs ⦈

{-# DISPLAY foldr.go f b xs = foldr f b xs #-}


foldl : (B → A → B) → B → List A → B
foldl f x []       = x
foldl f x (a ∷ as) = foldl f (f x a) as
```
-->

## Functorial action

It's also possible to lift a function `A → B` to a function `List A →
List B`.

```agda
instance
  Map-List : Map (eff List)
  Map-List = record { map = go } module map where
    go : (A → B) → List A → List B
    go f []       = []
    go f (x ∷ xs) = f x ∷ go f xs

{-# DISPLAY map.go f xs = map f xs #-}
```

## Monoidal structure

We can define concatenation of lists by recursion:

```agda
_++_ : ∀ {ℓ} {A : Type ℓ} → List A → List A → List A
[]       ++ ys = ys
(x ∷ xs) ++ ys = x ∷ (xs ++ ys)

  Append-List : ∀ {ℓ} {A : Type ℓ} → Append (List A)
  Append-List = record { mempty = [] ; _<>_ = _++_ }
```

## Predicates

We can define a function that determines if a boolean-valued
predicate holds on every element of a list.

```agda
all-of : ∀ {ℓ} {A : Type ℓ} → (A → Bool) → List A → Bool
all-of f [] = true
all-of f (x ∷ xs) = and (f x) (all-of f xs)
```

Dually, we can also define a function that determines if a boolean-valued
predicate holds on some element of a list.

```agda
any-of : ∀ {ℓ} {A : Type ℓ} → (A → Bool) → List A → Bool
any-of f [] = false
any-of f (x ∷ xs) = or (f x) (any-of f xs)
